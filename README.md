This is a gamejam product which is contributed by 5 another contributor.This product is here just because self-progress. I picked up the project as jam version so some orders/layouts is not belong to me and out of global order.

In project we playing a robots that kills other robots to level up and earn power ups. Every level have 2 power ups and every power ups has 2 effect (one positive and one negative) since the theme of Jam was *every input does two thing*. Player has to selecet one of them.
